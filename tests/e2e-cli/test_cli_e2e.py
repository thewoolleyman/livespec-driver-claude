"""Consumer wiring for the canonical CLI end-to-end harness.

Per livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md §"CLI end-to-end harness
contract", the harness itself is the single canonical implementation
that ships from `livespec-dev-tooling`
(`livespec_dev_tooling.testing.cli_e2e`); this Driver repo is a
CONSUMER. The consumer obligation relocated here from livespec core
together with the `/livespec:*` skill bindings (W4 Driver
extraction): structural skill discovery walks THIS repo's
`.claude-plugin/skills/*/SKILL.md` and reads the slash prefix from
`plugin.json`'s `name` — the in-repo plugin directory IS the source
of truth.

What runs in the `mock` tier (LIVESPEC_E2E_HARNESS=mock, in
`just check`):

- REAL structural skill discovery against `.claude-plugin/`;
- REAL per-skill fixture loading from `tests/e2e-cli/fixtures/<skill>/`;
- the REAL fail-closed time-bomb coverage gate;
- only the `claude -p` subprocess is mocked, via an injected
  deterministic runner that materializes each fixture's
  `expected_files`.

The `real` tier (LIVESPEC_E2E_HARNESS=real, NOT in `just check`)
drives the actual `claude` binary against the live API.

The red-baseline test at the bottom proves the coverage gate fails
CLOSED when a discovered skill lacks a fixture, then the happy-path
test proves it passes once every discovered skill is fixtured.
